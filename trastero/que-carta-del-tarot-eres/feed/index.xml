<p>The Star is a card that looks to the future. It does not predict any immediate or powerful change, but it does predict hope and healing. This card suggests clarity of vision, spiritual insight. And, most importantly, that unexpected help will be coming, with water to quench your thirst, with a guiding light to the future. They might say you&#8217;re a dreamer, but you&#8217;re not the only one.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ya decía yo que usted era una mala persona :P&lt;br /&gt;Jo... Qué guay el test... Yo soy la emperatriz!!!&lt;br /&gt;You are The Empress&lt;br /&gt;Beauty, happiness, pleasure, success, luxury, dissipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Empress is associated with Venus, the feminine planet, so it represents, beauty, charm, pleasure, luxury, and delight. You may be good at home decorating, art or anything to do with making things beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Empress is a creator, be it creation of life, of romance, of art or business. While the Magician is the primal spark, the idea made real, and the High Priestess is the one who gives the idea a form, the Empress is the womb where it gestates and grows till it is ready to be born. This is why her symbol is Venus, goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped. In fury and grief, she kept the Earth barren till her child was returned to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo, la última vez fui Han Solo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vaya, un hermitaño. Sin comentarios&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are The Hermit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prudence, Caution, Deliberation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hermit points to all things hidden, such as knowledge and inspiration,hidden enemies. The illumination is from within, and retirement from participation in current events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hermit is a card of introspection, analysis and, well, virginity. You do not desire to socialize; the card indicates, instead, a desire for peace and solitude. You prefer to take the time to think, organize, ruminate, take stock. There may be feelings of frustration and discontent but these feelings eventually lead to enlightenment, illumination, clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hermit represents a wise, inspirational person, friend, teacher, therapist. This a person who can shine a light on things that were previously mysterious and confusing.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;You are The Moon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope, expectation, Bright promises.&lt;br /&gt;The Moon is a card of magic and mystery - when prominent you know that nothing is as it seems, particularly when it concerns relationships. All logic is thrown out the window.&lt;br /&gt;The Moon is all about visions and illusions, madness, genius and poetry. This is a card that has to do with sleep, and so with both dreams and nightmares. It is a scary card in that it warns that there might be hidden enemies, tricks and falsehoods. But it should also be remembered that this is a card of great creativity, of powerful magic, primal feelings and intuition. You may be going through a time of emotional and mental trial; if you have any past mental problems, you must be vigilant in taking your medication but avoid drugs or alcohol, as abuse of either will cause them irreparable damage. This time however, can also result in great creativity, psychic powers, visions and insight. You can and should trust your intuition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Tarot Card are You?&lt;/b&gt;Take the Test to Find Out.]]></description>
